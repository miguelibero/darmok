C++ game engine combining opensource libraries & tools that I like

currently using:

* [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) as the renderer
* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as the build system 
* [vcpkg](https://vcpkg.io) as the package manager
* [glm](https://github.com/g-truc/glm) for 3d math
* [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) as the entity component system
* [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) for generic asset loading (not in runtime)
* [sol2](https://github.com/ThePhD/sol2) modern C++ bindings for lua
* [nlohmann-json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) for parsing json
* [pugixml](https://pugixml.org/) for parsing xml
* [imgui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui) for editor UI
    * [imGuizmo](https://github.com/CedricGuillemet/ImGuizmo) for editor controls
* [RmlUI](https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi) for ingame UI
* [ozz](https://github.com/guillaumeblanc/ozz-animation/) for 3d skeletal animations
* [protocol buffers](https://protobuf.dev/getting-started/cpptutorial/) for serialization
* [Jolt](https://github.com/jrouwe/JoltPhysics) for 3D physics
* [miniaudio](https://miniaud.io/) for audio
* [taskflow](https://github.com/taskflow/taskflow) for multithreading
* [tiny-process-lib](https://gitlab.com/eidheim/tiny-process-library) to run os processes
* [mikktspace](http://www.mikktspace.com/) - to calculate tangents
* [middleclass](https://github.com/kikito/middleclass) - small object orientation lua lib
* [cli11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) - command line parser
* [tinyfiledialogs](https://sourceforge.net/projects/tinyfiledialogs/) - native file dialogs
* [tl-expected](https://github.com/TartanLlama/expected) - expected for C++20
* [magic_enum](https://github.com/Neargye/magic_enum) automatically convert enum types
* [fmt](https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt) for string formatting
* [utfcpp](https://github.com/nemtrif/utfcpp) for unicode string encoding

planned to use:
* [tracy](https://github.com/wolfpld/tracy) for frame profiling
    (blocked because of [bgfx#3308](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx/pull/3308)
    and the vcpkg bgfx build not having a profiler feature)
* [recast navigation](http://recastnav.com/) for pathfinding
* [BehaviorTree.CPP](https://www.behaviortree.dev/) for behavior trees
* [Box2D](https://box2d.org/) 2D physics
* [ldtk](https://ldtk.io/) for 2D level editor
* [spine](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes) for 2d skeletal animations
* [slang](https://github.com/shader-slang/slang) unified shader language that compiles to  the different render backends

Trying to target the following platforms:
* desktop (windows, macos, linux)
* mobile (iOS, Android) (pending)

Some philosofical decisions (could be controversial)
* use modern C++ (20) patterns where possible
* use as much stl as possible (need to look into memory management at some point)
* no naked pointers
* return `expected` for error handling
* try to keep the API similar to Unity3D (where it makes sense) so that it's easy to port game logic

**WARNING**: currently in early stages of development

## Frequently Asked Questions

* Will it have feature X?
> Depends on what I need. Anyone is welcome to fork and submit PRs.

## Current State

I'm still learning CMake, so if you see something that should be fixed please let me know.

### Working features

        * basic phong
        * PBR metallic-roughness
    * cascaded shadow mapping
    * ambient, directional, spot & point light shadows
    * camera culling (frustum, occlusion seems to be broken)
* asset system
    * sprites and spritesheets
    * loading models using assimp (FBX, gltf, etc...)
    * serializing assets into protocol buffers
* entity component scene using entt
    * transform, camera

## Example code

```lua
function init()
    local program = StandardProgramLoader.load(StandardProgramType.Forward)

    local scenes = app:add_component(SceneAppComponent)
    local scene = scenes.scene

    local camEntity = scene:create_entity()
    local camTrans = camEntity:add_component(Transform, { 0, 1, -1 })
    camTrans:look_at({ 0, 0, 0 })
    local cam = camEntity:add_component(Camera)
    cam:set_perspective(60, 0.3, 1000)
    cam:add_component(ForwardRenderer)
    cam:add_component(LightingRenderComponent)

    local lightEntity = scene:create_entity()
    lightEntity:add_component(AmbientLight, 0.2)
    lightEntity:add_component(Transform, { 1, 1, -1 })
    local light = lightEntity:add_component(PointLight, 2)
    light.range = 5

    local mesh = MeshData.new_sphere():create_mesh(program.vertex_layout)
    scene:create_entity():add_component(Renderable, mesh, program, Color.green)
end
