C++ engine using libraries that I like

* [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as the build system 
* [bgfx](https://github.com/bkaradzic/bgfx) as the renderer
* [spine](https://github.com/EsotericSoftware/spine-runtimes) for 2d skeletal animations
* [assimp](https://github.com/assimp/assimp) generic asset loading
* [wren](https://github.com/wren-lang/wren) as the scripting layer
* [EnTT](https://github.com/skypjack/entt) as the entity component system

Trying to use modern C++ patterns where possible

* no naked pointers
* coroutines for async

Trying to target the following platforms

* windows
* mobile (iOS, Android)

Pending tasks
